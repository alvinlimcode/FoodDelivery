# Food Delivery Web App
A sample food delivery web app is developed using ASP.NET Core, bootstrap, jQuery, vue.js, and HTML localStorage. This project demo how to structure the solutions into different projects also.

## Getting Started
The homepage demo loading the foods listing by calling ajax Web API in vue.js through the C# backend code. The data is stored in SQL Server and access using Entity Framework with LINQ. 

The frontend UI uses bootstrap3 CSS, vue.js and jQuery. The vue.js is vesatile, flexible and very good at controlling the UI logic with minimal code compare to jQuery.

When the button "Add to Cart" is clicked, the food will be added to the shopping cart which is store in HTML localStorage of the browser. Storing shopping cart in HTML localStorage is better than cookies. When the user view the shopping cart again, the vue.js code will load the data from HTML localStorage again.
